# Just a few thoughts on the relative performance of the main building blocks of dealing with Envelopes, and how this
# affect our decision making. On my local laptop (local loopback, django dev server), with a single 50KiB event, I
# measured the following approximate timtings:
# 0.00001s just get the bytes
# 0.0002s get bytes & gunzip
# 0.0005s get bytes, gunzip & json load
#
# The goal of having an ingest/digest split is to keep the server responsive in times of peek load. It is _not_ to have
# get crazy good throughput numbers (because ingest isn't the bottleneck anyway).
#
# One consideration was: should we just store the compressed envelope on-upload. Answer, given the numbers above: not
# needed, fine to unpack. This is also prudent from the perspective of storage, because the envelope may contain much
# more stuff that we don't care about (up to 20MiB compressed) whereas the max event size (uncompressed) is 1MiB.
# Another advantage: this allows us to raise the relevant Header parsing and size limitation Exceptions to the SDKs.
