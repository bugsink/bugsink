# All DB-altering work that the threads do is wrapped in BEGIN IMMEDIATELY transactions, which thus serve as a mutex of
# sorts, because the threads cannot start a transaction when another thread is in a transaction. However, it seems that
# this mechanism does not serve as a mutex from the perspective of checkpointing. My hypothesis/understanding is that
# when thread A does a COMMIT, thread B's transaction can start. It is at that point that thread A attempts its
# checkpointing, which it cannot do because thread B has already started a new transaction.
#
# (Additional evidence for this theory, not mentioned on the internet is: in the pre-semaphore setup, I see the log for
# "BEGIN" appearing (sometimes a few miliseconds) before "IMMEDIATE" (which is when the __exit__ is complete). I
# temporarily added an extra "ABOUT TO BEGIN" log statement for clarification.
#
# Supporting evidence for this hypothesis is: when I wrap a Python lock around the transaction (which makes thread B
# wait until thread A has returned from its COMMIT), checkpointing does succeed.
#
# The immediate_semaphore is TSTTCPW to serialize writes more aggressively than just using IMMEDIATE. (For cross-process
# locking that's still no help, but [a] in the recommended setup there is barely any cross-process locking and [b] this
# lock only is only there to prevent WAL-growth, it's not for correctness (IMMEDIATE is for correctness).) implemented
# as a hard-coded dict to avoid having to implement locking around the a lazy initializer.

    Sqlite specific (for other DBs this is simply ignored).

    immediate_atomic allows us to begin atomic transactions using BEGIN IMMEDIATE instead of the default BEGIN. The
    sqlite docs explain a context in which this is useful:

    > Another example: X starts a read transaction using BEGIN and SELECT, then Y makes a changes to the database using
    > UPDATE. Then X tries to make a change to the database using UPDATE. The attempt by X to escalate its transaction
    > from a read transaction to a write transaction fails with an SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT error because the snapshot of
    > the database being viewed by X is no longer the latest version of the database. If X were allowed to write, it
    > would fork the history of the database file, which is something SQLite does not support. [..]

    > **If X starts a transaction that will initially only read but X knows it will eventually want to write and does
    > not want to be troubled with possible SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT errors that arise because another connection jumped
    > ahead of it in line, then X can issue BEGIN IMMEDIATE to start its transaction instead of just an ordinary
    > BEGIN.** The BEGIN IMMEDIATE command goes ahead and starts a write transaction, and thus blocks all other writers.
    > If the BEGIN IMMEDIATE operation succeeds, then no subsequent operations in that transaction will ever fail with
    > an SQLITE_BUSY error.

    Django 5.1 will introduce the option to configure BEGIN IMMEDIATE, but only globally. This is not what we want,
    because it unnecessarily escalates read-only-transactions into write-transactions.

    https://github.com/django/django/pull/17760

    PoC of the problem (which indeed goes away by converting to immediate); run in 2 separate shells to demonstrate it:

    from time import sleep
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from django.db import transaction

    @transaction.atomic()
    def read_sleep_write():
        print("I am going to read")
        user = User.objects.first()
        print("I am going to sleep")
        sleep(5)
        print("I am going to write")
        user.save() # no need to actually change the user, as long as we run a write query

    ## why transactions:
    One more note that I have trouble integrating into the story-line. Django says

    > Atomicity is the defining property of database transactions.

    But this is not true. But we also care about isolation (views on the data) and about serializability (the order of
    transactions). In particular serializability (locking out other writers) is what we are after here.
