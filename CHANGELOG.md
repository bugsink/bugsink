# Changes

## 2.0.2 (22 September 2025)

* Fix broken checkbox in issue list (See #225)

## 2.0.1 (16 September 2025)

2 docker-related fixes (e346f8d5c22a and aa799e9c940f)

## 2.0.0 (16 September 2025)

### Backwards incompatible changes

* Python 3.9 is no longer supported

[Unless you're running Debian Bullseye this will not affect you](12af5302efdd).

The minimum supported version for the database backends has been raised to:

* SQLite ≥ 3.31.0
* MySQL ≥ 8.0.11
* PostgreSQL ≥ 14
* MariaDB ≥ 10.5

[Overview of typical versions in various
OSes](https://github.com/bugsink/bugsink/pull/89#issuecomment-3253843464)

#### Non-root Docker

The provided Docker container no longer runs the Bugsink process as the root
user. This improves security (defense in depth), but may require changes to
your setup (i.e. volume permissions).

Setups that mount the `/data` dir as a volume must ensure that the directory is
owned by UID 14237 (the user the process runs as inside the container).
[Further migration
instructions](https://github.com/bugsink/bugsink/issues/176#issuecomment-3139184180)

If you have not mounted any volumes, you will not be visibly affected by this change.

#### Hardening of Temporary-Directory

Bugsink now requires ownership of the `INGEST_STORE_BASE_DIR` directory to avoid
certain classes of local privilege escalation attacks. (see #174)

If you manually configured this directory to be something that the process
running Bugsink _cannot_ own (e.g. to `/tmp/` without a further subdir), you
must change it to something it can own (e.g. the default of `/tmp/bugsink/ingestion`)

The Docker image is not affected by this (manual configuration wasn't possible to
begin with).

## 1.5.3 (7 May 2025)

* Performance fixes of the issue-list when there are many (millions) of _issues_ (rather than just events) in the
  database; see aad0f624f904 & 0dfd01db9b38.

* Fix: `different_runtime_limit` applying to the wrong DB alias, see 699f6e587d28

* `CREATE_SUPERUSER` shortcut: robust for ':' in password, see 9b0f0e04f4e4

## 1.5.2 (6 May 2025)

Various performance fixes when there are many (millions) of _issues_
(rather than just events) in the database:

* Add index for `Grouping.grouping_key` (and project), see 392f5a30be18, 49e6700d4a81
* Digest: check Grouping.exists only once (save a query)
* Remove `open_issue_count` from homepage; it's too expensive
* Issue Paginator: don't attempt to count the Issues, see 378366105496
* Stress test command: more fat-tailed randomness (d5a449020d03)

Compatibility fix:

## 1.5.1 (24 April 2025)

Various fixes and improvements:

* 2 new tools to get a handle on performance of systems under load:
    * A [snappea-stats] subcommand to gain insight in
    * A page was added at `http://YOURINSTALL/counts/` that shows, for each type of object, the number of objects in the
      DB. (superuser only)

* Fix `different_runtime_limit` race conditions, see 53d4be818334
* `immediate_semaphore`: implement alias "using", see 67f769d3e5be
* `immediate atomic` 'get-write-lock' performance logging: fix it, see f8db5edf82ed

* Various improvements in the yellow warning bar for "backlogged snappea":
    * Better 'yellow bar' for snappea warnings (using Stat info)
    * Oldest task age warning: display as int
    * snappea task warning should itself never slow down the site (max runtime)

* Add some examples to the "conf templates"
    * `EVENT_STORAGES`: add (commented-out) example configuration to `conf_templates`
    * Clarify options for `EMAIL_BACKEND` in the `conf_templates`

* When is the `email_system_warning` shown? change & document
* Snappea foreman: on catastrophic errors, wait for workers, see 9b6fbe523f3c
* Explain tailwind usage during development & vendoring step, see 5c0e45a16db2
* Fix Header/Grouper for Log Messages using deprecated SDKs (See #85)

* `EMAIL_USE_TLS`: false by default (as was documented). See 7c3c19b6c8f2
* `EMAIL_USE_SSL`: `not EMAIL_USE_TLS` by default (avoids crashing on "both
  true" when only `EMAIL_USE_TLS` is explicitly configured

## 1.5.0 (14 April 2025)

Bugsink 1.5.0 introduces preliminary support for sourcemaps.

_preliminary_ because only the following combination (all must apply) of features works:

* Uploading "manually", using `sentry-cli`
* sourcemaps & sources are related using `debug-id`, which must be injected by `sentry-cli`

Tested with the followin `sentry-cli` invocation:

```
uglifyjs captureException.js   -o captureException.min.js   --source-map url=captureException.min.js.map,includeSources
sentry-cli sourcemaps inject captureException.min.js captureException.min.js.map
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=a sentry-cli --url https://YOURBUGSINK/ sourcemaps --org bugsinkhasnoorgs --project=ignoredalso upload .
```

Implemented with 3 endpoints Bugsink-side:

* upload-chunks GET tells the CLI what our capabilities are
* upload-chunks POST allows the CLI to upload the files (the CLI bundles everything first, and adds a manifest)
* assemble-artifact: unpack that thing and put it in the right location.

[This comment contains a longer overview of the current state](https://github.com/bugsink/bugsink/issues/19#issuecomment-2796304379)

### Further Features & Fixes

* Add `EMAIL_USE_SSL` to settings/templates.

* Print full stacktraces when _not_ dogfooding (i.e. when sentry-sdk is not configured).

* Various Dockerfile improvements (See #68 and the top of the Dockerfile for details)

* Allow users to join their own team's projects Fix #56
* Don't crash on non-str tag-values: Fixes #76

* Add `user.id`, `user.username`, `user.email` and `user.ip_address` tags in `deduce_tags`
  allows for direct matching on one of those rather than just "whatever is avaialble"
  (which goes into the not further qualified `user` tag)

## 1.4.2 (1 April 2025)

* `deduce_allowed_hosts`: allow for localhost, see #46
* `retention_max_event_count`: in project settings form
* `issue.stored_event_count`: fix (it was incorrectly calculated). Running the migrations will
    automatically fix the existing values too.
* Fix user tag deduction (user tags were not correctly calculated from the event data)

## 1.4.1 (17 March 2025)

* Bugfixes on the experimental postgres support, see #21, #61
* sqlite: per-query timeout configurable
* Make `EMAIL_TIMEOUT` configurable on Docker, fixes #60

## 1.4.0 (13 March 2025)

### Introducing (Tag-based) Search

Bugsink 1.4.0 [introduces tag-based search](https://www.bugsink.com/blog/introducing-search/).

* Support for searching both **Issues** and individual **Events**.
* Search is built entirely on **tags** (both user-supplied and deduced from event properties).
* **Simple query language**: `key:value` pairs for structured filtering.
* Search is **implemented directly in the database**, ensuring a simple and efficient architecture.

Because tags take such a key role in the implementation of search, the introduction of search is coupled with per-issue
tag overviews, see #36 & #12. i.e. per issue pages show a breakdown-by-tag; and a special page (showing up to 25 values)
for tags is introduced.

NOTE: when upgrading to 1.4.0 tags for already-seen events are not automatically calculated (for large databases, this
could make migrating very annoying). You can either wait a while (the tags for as of yet unseen events will be added)
or run the `init_tags` command to determine the tags for the already-existing issues and events.

### Further Features & Fixes

* Postgres: experimental support: our testsuite now runs against postgres, and configuring the Docker image to run with
  a postgres backend is possible. No further testing has been done, but this at least makes such experiments possible.
  See #21

* Createsuperuser pre-start: don't do that when _any_ users exist in the DB (Fixes #54)

* Show remaining (in db, AKA 'available') number of events in the issue-list (when some events have been evicted from
  the DB, the issue list shows the _actually availale_ number of events in a smaller font next to the total seen number.

* Details page: be robust for top-level message-as-string (Fixes #55)

* Add 'level' to logentry event details

* Issue.calculated_* fields: fix lengths (fixes an issue on MySQL)

## 1.3.0 (20 February 2025)

### Introduce FileEventStorage

An (optional) way to store the `event_data` (full event as JSON)
outside the DB. This is expected to be useful for larger setups,
because it gives you:

* A more portable database (e.g. backups); (depeding on event size
  the impact on your DB is ~50x.
* Less worries about hitting "physical" limits (e.g. disk size, max
  file size) for your DB.

Presumably (more testing will happen going forwards) it will:

* Speed up migrations (especially on sqlite, which does full table copies)

However: Ingestion speed does not seem to notacibly changed (either
way) with this change.

Related utilities:

* `migrate_to_current_eventstorage` command: a command to move data over.
* `cleanup_eventstorage` command: a "vacuum" of sorts.

### Further Features

* Pagination on the Issues list
* Event-detail UI for Logentries: show `logentry.message` and `logentry.params`
* UI: thousand-separators for counts
* Support for top-level `message` in events (See #43)
* `nuke_events` command improvements: more consistent behavior, better confirmation.
* `make_consistent` command improvements: more affected cases, run in transaction
* `migrate` command: always shows timings
* `showstat` command: `digestion_speed`
* Send welcome email: as a command
* Support for CORS

### Fixes

* transaction semaphore: ensure release for exceptions while _entering_ the transaction

### Cleanup / refactoring

* Move MoreLoudlyFailingTransport out of the default 'eat_your_own_dogfood' conf
* allow long-running queries on long-running commands (`nuke_events`, `make_consistent`)
* DB indexes for the issue-lists (including filters)
* Don't 'eat your own dogfood' (send errors to backend) while running tests
* `delete_with_limit` was removed; this removes one tie-in to MySQL/Sqlite (See #21)
* Print task's name in Snappea log when "Done"

## 1.2.0 (11 February 2025)

### Features

* Docker: The SQLite database now defaults to being stored in `/data/`, with a warning if the directory needs to be created.
* Show 'event grouping', 'handled' and 'mechanism' in the event details
* Ingestion performance fixes (most notable when >1M events are stored). See 615d2da4c8b5
* UI performance fixes (most notable in the UI, when >1M events are stored). See 86e8c4318bc2

### Bug Fixes

* Transaction semaphore fixes prevent deadlocks
* Various fields are cut off at max length to avoid (1406, "Data too long for column ...")` errors in MySQL.
* Ensured `digested_at` time is set correctly.
* Added indexes on fields used for ordering
* UI: 'This might mean' refers to 'No open issues'; make this show in the interface

### Cleanup / refactoring

* Remove 2 fields that were "temporary [..] to get a sense of the shape of the data
* Set up dependabot
* Update dependencies (as per dependabot)
* Datamodel: `Event.grouping`, which ensures every event has a consistent Grouping associated with it.
* Move 'DESIGN*' docs out of repo
* Mention Security Policiy in CONTRIBUTING.md
* squashmigrations (faster startup for fresh installations)
