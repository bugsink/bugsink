class Foreman:
    """
    The Foreman starts workers, as (threading.Thread) threads, based on snappea.Task objects it finds in the sqlite
    database for that purpose (we use the DB as a simple MQ, we call this DBasMQ).

    The Foreman code itself is single-threaded, so it can be easily reasoned about.

    We provide an at-most-once guarantee: Tasks that are picked up are removed from the DB before the works starts.
    This fits with our model of background tasks, namely
    * things that you want to happen
    * but you don't want to wait for them in the request-response loop
    * getting them done for sure is not more important than in the server itself (which is also subject to os.kill)
    * you don't care about the answer as part of your code (of course, the DB can be affected)

    The read/writes to the DB-as-MQ are as such:

    * "some other process" (the HTTP server) writes _new_ Tasks
    * the Foreman reads Tasks (determines the workload)
    * the Foreman deletes (a write operation) Tasks (when done)

    Because the Foreman has a single sequential loop, and because it is the only thing that _updates_ tasks, there is no
    need for a locking model of some sort. sqlite locks the whole DB on-write, of course, but in this case we don't use
    that as a feature. The throughput of our MQ is limited by the speed with which we can do writes to sqlite (2 writes
    and at most 2 reads are needed per task (2 reads, because 1 to determine 'no more work'; when there are many items
    at the same time, the average amount of reads may be <1 because we read a whole list)). Performance on personal
    laptop: 1000 trivial tasks are finished enqueue-to-finished in a few seconds.

    The main idea is this endless loop of checking for new work and doing it. This leaves the question of how we "go to
    sleep" when there is no more work and how we wake up from that. This is implemented using inotify on a directory
    created specifically for that purpose (for each Task a file is dropped there) (and a blocking read on the INotify
    object). Note that this idea is somewhat incidental though (0MQ or polling the DB in a busy loop are some
    alternatives). Performance: write/inotify/delete of a single wake-up call is in the order of n*e-5 on my laptop.

        # > If a connection is created in a long-running process, outside of Djangoâ€™s request-response cycle, the
        # > connection will remain open until explicitly closed, or timeout occurs.
        #
        # In addition to that (not explicitly mentioned): thread-close does not close the connection automatically. The
        # present method is thus called for both the long-running foreman, and the individual worker-threads on-close.
        #
        # Cleaning up after ourselves is "probably a good idea", i.e. not doing that will probably cause various
        # hard-to-track problems. (the particular problem that put me on this path was a growing WAL file); details:
        # https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/579fe4a0f9d1e1fd
        #
        # I am aware that calling connection.close() rolls back any open transactions, but it is assumed that this is
        # unlikely to happen accidentally because of our style of programming and Django's toolchain. Namely: explicit
        # transactions are programmed using context_processors or method decorators. Calling connection.close() inside
        # those constructs stands out. And outside of such decorators you're in autocommit because that's what Django
        # does.
        #
        # Connection close (and subsequent reopen) has a cost that's documented in DESIGN-connections.md.
        #
        # Calling connection.close unnecessarily does not incur extra cost, because of `if self.connection is not None`
        # in django.db.backends.base.base.DatabaseWrapper. (this is also the reason repeated calls to connection.close()
        # are not a problem). (`connection` below is actually a ConnectionProxy, but it delegates to a DatabaseWrapper).
        # Note that just calling .close() is hitting the right one because Django has a connection-per-thread model.
        #
        # None of the above is a problem in the gunicorn setup because Django does per-request cleanup in those cases.
        # For runserver there's this caveat: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35577
        #
        # Regarding the fear of e.g. `kill -9` not closing the connection, I have found the following quote: 'the
        # user-visible consequence of not closing "the db" before the application exits should be precisely the same as
        # if it was closed before exiting'. https://sqlite.org/forum/info/fc8d6e0ee055fef88a08f5092061108261445d17153457
