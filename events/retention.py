    #
    # (This is what we chose because we want 0-aged to have an age-based irrelevance of 0); i.e. that's where the +1
    # comes from.
    #
    # The base of 4 was chosen after some experimentation/consideration; it's certainly not a scientific choice. Note
    # that the age based irrelevance is the easiest to tune out of the 2, because it's a simple logarithm (i.e. we don't
    # need to count bits/leading zeroes) and because it is calculated on demand rather than stored in the DB.
    #
    # Why we picked 4: if you consider quota in the range of 10_000 - 1_000_000, the nonzero_leading_bits will lead to
    # event-irrelevances of max 15 - 21 respectively. However, after evicting for max events I've observed this to be in
    # the 8 - 12 range for the 10_000 case. Choosing 4 as the base for age-based means that the irrelevance for an event
    # that is 1 year old is about 6.5 (log(24 * 365, 4)), which makes it so that even 1 year old events are not
    # necessarily evicted if they were "the most relevant ones".
    #
    # Another way of thinking about this: for the value of 4, the change in irrelevance for an event going from one week
    # old to one month old, or an event going from a bit over a day to a week old is comparable to an event being one of
    # twice as many events. This feels more correct than e.g. using base 2, where the change in irrelevance takes a
    # "step" at each doubling.
    #
    # at the integer values for irrelevance this works out like so:
    # age = 0 => irrelevance = 0
    # age = 1 => irrelevance = 0.5
    # age = 2 => irrelevance = 0.792
    # age = 3 => irrelevance = 1
    # age = 15 => irrelevance = 2
    #
    # to work back from a given integer "budget" of irrelevance (after the (integer) item-based irrelevance has been
    # subtracted from the total max), we can simply take `4^budget - 1` to get the 'age of eviction', the number of
    # epochs we must go back. The following code helps me understand this:
    #
    # >>> for budget in range(20):
    # ...     age = pow(4, budget) - 1
    # ...     print("budget: %s, age: %s" % (budget, age))

    # want to avoid doing it too often. For the completely reasonable quota of 10_000 events or more, this just means
    # 500; for lower quota we take 5% to avoid evicting too much (at a small performance penalty).
    #
    # One reason to pick no higher than 500 (and to delete_with_limit) is that we want to avoid blocking too long on a
    # single eviction. (both on a single query, to avoid timeouts, but also on the eviciton as a whole, because it
    # would block other threads/processes and trigger timeouts there). On the slow VPS we've observed deletions taking
    # in the order of 1-4ms per event, so 500 would put us at 2s, which is still less than 50% of the timeout value.

    # different story). 5% seems close enough to the limit to stem the "why was so much deleted" questions.
