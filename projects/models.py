# ## Visibility/Access-design
#
# Some more "philosophical/architectural" thoughts on visibility and access across projects and teams. As bullets:
#
# * The primary way to organize issues is the _project_
# * A Team models a group of people that work together on related projects.
# * A Team membership implies: Project-membership is available (a "Join" button is shown, no further approval needed)
# * Project-membership must be explicitly opted into.
#       This is "as it stands", i.e. that's how it currently works; I'm not committed to that approach though. Reasons
#       in favor of this approach:
#       * explicit over implicit
#       * forces a choice about notification settings on the user.
#       * allows users to self-organise their workflow: not everyone on every team cares about every project.
#       against / possible changes
#       * yet another action needed
#       * possible change: allow access to the project without clicking "join", but keep it in a separate tab (workflow)
#
# * visibility of teams does not affect visibility of associated projects
# * user.is_superuser can see/do everything
#
# Some open ends/ choices to be made:
#
# * team admin role: should it be inherited on the project level? My sense is "yes", and this is implemented in
#     `_check_project_admin` but not in the templates.
# * team admins currently have the ability to see projects, diverging from the "explicitly opted into" rule. Makes some
#       sense, but could be an argument for the general "allow access" option mentioned above.
# * if there are very many generally visible teams/projects, some more means of organisation may be needed (search?).
#       a first step towards that is probably: navigate by-team (we currently just have a "team projects" tab.
#       "icebox" though, because at that scale we'll first have to deal with other questions of scale.

    # the project's existance is visible, but the project itself is not. the idea would be that you can "request to
    # join" (which is currently not implemented as a button, but you could do it 'out of bands' i.e. via email or chat).

    # having projects that are part of a certain team, but not visible to the team members, was considered, but
    # rejected. The basic thinking on the rejection is: it would hollow out the concept of Team to the point of
    # meaninglessness. If you want "secret" projects, you can just create a hidden team (possibly even with just a
    # single member) and add the project to that.
